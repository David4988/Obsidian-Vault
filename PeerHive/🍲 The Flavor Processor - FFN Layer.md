*Core Idea:* After attention gathers the right information, a Feed-Forward Network (FFN) processes it to create richer meaning.

* *Analogy:* A chef's food processor.
* *Attention:* Gathers the raw ingredients (e.g., the most relevant image patches).
* *FFN:* Blends those ingredients together to create complex flavors that weren't there before. It finds the relationships between the gathered parts.

This step is crucial for learning complex, non-linear patterns from the attended information.
