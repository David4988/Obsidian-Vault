*Core Idea:* Instead of one big conversation, we run multiple (e.g., 8) parallel conversations, with each "head" becoming a specialist.

* *Why?* To capture different kinds of relationships simultaneously.
* *Analogy:* A team of detectives investigating a scene.
    * *Head 1 (The Color Specialist):* Focuses only on matching color words to color pixels.
    * *Head 2 (The Action Specialist):* Focuses only on verbs and postures.
    * *Head 3 (The Vibe Specialist):* Focuses on the overall mood or composition.

This prevents the model from getting stuck on the most obvious connection and allows it to build a much richer, more holistic understanding.
