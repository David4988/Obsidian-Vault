*Core Idea:* To make text and image data understand each other, they need to have a structured, two-way conversation.

* *Text asks Image (🗣➡🖼):* "Given the words in this caption, what parts of the image are most important?"
    * Example: For the text "a man in a green shirt," this attention focuses on the pixels that form the person and their clothing.
* *Image asks Text (🖼➡🗣):* "Given the pixels in this image, what words in the caption best describe them?"
    * Example: The pixels showing a grassy area will direct attention to the word "yard" in the text.

This process enriches both modalities with context from the other, creating "smarter" representations than if they were processed in isolation.
