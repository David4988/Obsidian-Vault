[[Maven Lifecycle Phases]]

Maven has **3 major lifecycles**, each containing multiple phases and goals:

1. **`clean`** – removes temporary directories and build artifacts
    
2. **`default`** – the core build lifecycle (compile → package → install → deploy)
    
3. **`site`** – generates documentation and project reports
