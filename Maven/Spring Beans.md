  
-  Spring beans are **objects** that are **managed** by the Spring Framework   
  
-  Concrete classes supply the logic that makes up the Spring application  
  
- Three ways to define them  
  
1.  `@Bean` in a config class  
  
2.  `@Component` in a component class  
  
3.  `@Service` in a service class
